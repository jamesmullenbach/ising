Group project for Computational Physics class at GT.
Models the process of ferromagnetism, demonstrating how spins align with their neighbors over time - or don't align, depending on the temperature of the system.
Included are programs to run many simulations and report the energy and magnetization per site (that is, per particle), for data analysis purposes.
